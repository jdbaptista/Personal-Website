            "Move fast and break things" is a motto many programmers live by. Breaking
            things is the inevitable byproduct of moving fast, however you are likely
            to move slow in the long run if you plan on fixing the things that are broken.
            Here is an example of when moving fast can go wrong.

            Suppose that there is a critical bug in matInitializeBus1, which is causing
            a failure code to be returned. How quickly can the bug be identified and how 
            quickly can the bug be fixed? In this case, the bug is in initialization code, 
            so the overall system will likely crash before even starting. Although it can
            be identified quickly, it will not be quick to fix. Suppose the calling code
            looks like this:

            The error code that is logged at the top-level will be "err: -1". Brilliant.
            It's easy enough to change the code to reveal the actual error, wait for a 
            recompile and, if you're writing firmware for a microcontroller, wait for the binary to flash.

            The error code returned from initLedMatrix() is discovered to be "err: -1". 
            It has been confirmed that one of the four calls in initLedMatrix is returning
            ESP_FAIL. Enlightening. This is not likely to be informative, however if only
            one of the four functions returns ESP_FAIL and it only returns ESP_FAIL in
            a very particular failure case, then it truly is enlightening. Unfortunately,
            that is not the case here. All four of the functions return ESP_FAIL if any
            error occurs. I will give you a hint and say that there is an error inside matInitializeBus1, shown below.

            flash, read logs: "err: -1". Time for a debugger, but the PCB was designed quickly
            and doesn't expose JTAG pins, so it will either be a lot of inspection or some

            The error in this example is very replicable, so this iterative process 
            will eventually work and all the bugs will be fixed. However, when working with 
            FreeRTOS tasks, some bugs may arise due to infrequent race conditions.
            In these cases, it is important that what is logged is informative
            the first time because it is unlikely the bug will occur again during development.
            Ideally, the logs will show where the bug occurred and under what conditions.
            Another aspect of error codes that needs to be considered is runtime recoverability,
            which won't be discussed here.

                A quick way to log exactly where bugs occurred and some of the conditions
                that led to failure is to log a stack trace whenever a bottom-level error occurs.
                By bottom-level error, I mean an error using a library function that you
                do not control, such as an I2C HAL function. To the right is an example

            Informatively logging application state is a difficult problem, which is one I will
            not focus on much here. However, one of the issues that I've run into while
            trying to keep accurate logs of what occurs in my programs is memory
            constraints because keeping many strings in the program increases the
            binary size. This has been a headache to deal with in a recent project
            that already has a lot of information to store. In the case of my
            project, much memory is consumed by led matrix register mappings and
            Kicad PCB coordinates of the leds.

            There are two issues that arise from using a predefined set of error
            codes in an application. First, the conditions of a particular error
            may not cleanly fit into one of the provided codes. This is not a
            major issue as long as the conditions under which a function returns
            a particular code are well documented. The more worrying issue, which
            was the main issue in the example, is error code collision. It may
            be unreasonable to print a stack trace that is informative, in which
            case error codes must not only encode the failure state, but also
            encode the location where the error occurred.

            The initLedMatrix function was an example of this because there were
            four separate failure locations and only one error code attempting
            to encode all of them. Using the expanded set of codes
            can be useful to specify the source of an error. The code below

            The issue of non-descriptive error codes should be clear now. ESP_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED
            is encoding an error that should mean "Received an invalid response while
            initializing I2C bus 2". As the code description is not helpful, it will
            take some time to track the error down the call stack to determine the
            actual source and meaning of the code. Even this can be difficult if the
            code is passed through many functions and aliased many times, especially
            if the codebase makes heavy use of function pointers. This can be avoided 
            by defining custom error codes, such as ERR_INIT_I2CBUS2_INVALID_RESPONSE,
            for each potential failure point in the program.

        <br>
        <div class="post-text">
            Searching for the failure will be easier, as a search through the codebase
            for ERR_INIT_I2CBUS2_INVALID_RESPONSE will determine the source. In ESP-IDF,
            a tag is added to each log statement, which is useful for determining the
            source of a log. If the log is made at the bottom-level function where the
            error is made, the tag can be used to mark which file or component the error
            originated within. However, if the log is made at the top-level function to save
            binary space on logging calls, then the search will be through the entire codebase.
            In this case, it is important that the error code hints at where in the codebase
            the error originates from. MAT_ERR_INIT_I2CBUS2_INVALID_RESPONSE is preferrable to ERR_INIT_I2CBUS2_INVALID_RESPONSE
            because it hints at which component the error code belongs to. This idea can be
            seen in the ESP-IDF error code header file below. Each BASE describes a particular section of ESP-IDF code, so the search is through
            just a single section instead of the entire codebase.

            Being verbose with error codes is positive for the reasons I have mentioned before,
            however it does slow down development to perhaps an unacceptable degree, depending
            on application requirements. One of the main reasons it is slow is that it requires determining
            whether there are error code collisions within the codebase. This itself requires
            well documented code to complete in a reasonable amount of time, which takes
            up even more time. Below is the implementation of the function that can throw all of those errors. 
            It contains bottom-level error logging with THROW_APP_ERR, error code aliasing,
            custom error codes with codebase location hints, and selective error code collisions.

                The example keeps track of which return statements collide with
                others in the function by casting error codes to esp_err_t. This
                cast is meaningless to the compiler, but tells readers of the code
                that they can be sure an error originated from a particular exit path
                without having to scour the functions being called. For example,
                it might seem that "return ESP_FAIL" will collide with "THROW_APP_ERR(err)",
                however this is not true because i2c_master_transmit_receive does not
                actually throw ESP_FAIL. This is similar to the MISRA-C guideline that
                ignored error codes must be intentionally documented in the code by casting
                the result to void. An example of this is in a best-effort function, such
                as when an error has already occurred and indication to the user is simply
                a courtesy.

            Note that the error code ESP_ERR_INVALID_ARG in the example is colliding for
            the conditions "result == NULL" and "page > 4". As I don't expect these to
            be common errors, I decided they do not need to be distinguished. It should
            be somewhat clear from other logs which case is occurring. Another way to
            simplify the set of codes returned by the function could be to ignore mutex
            errors and have them collide with ESP_FAIL because they should never occur.
            Overall, proper error handling is time consuming, but debugging without it
            is worse. There is an art in finding the middle ground between giving yourself
            a rough idea of where a bug occurred and having a rough time squashing it.
