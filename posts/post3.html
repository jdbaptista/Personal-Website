        Mocking ESP-IDF Components in VSCode

            As projects grow in complexity, the possibility for issues also increases, which
            brings the need for sophisitcated testing techniques. One such technique, called mocking, 
            uses mock objects to simulate behavior of dependencies. This allows the programmer to test
            a unit of code for correctness without depending on correct dependency implementations.
            Another use of mocking that is particularly relevant when developing firmware 
            is to remove/simulate hardware dependencies. This can allow the code under test to be run 
            or emulated on another platform, such as Linux, which can significantly speed up the testing process.

            ESP-IDF has a method to mock ESP-IDF components that removes hardware dependencies
            (which can only be run on Linux), however I struggled to find a simple way to run 
            unit tests that required mocks of my own project components. I found this necessary
            in order to test functions that have side effects, such as one that changes
            the state of an LED indicator through a function in another component. The method 
            I describe in this article allows you to mock project components using CMock when
            developing with ESP-IDF under the ESP-IDF VSCode extension v1.10.0. The method exploits
            the extension's multiple configuration feature to keep tests organized and uses some 
            simple CMake to dynamically modify component sources. This article assumes you have
            some familiarity with ESP-IDF and creating/testing project components. There are articles
            in the ESP-IDF documentation that are helpful background, particularly the 'Build System'
            and 'Unit Testing' API Guides.

            Before diving into the system, I will quickly note some of it's drawbacks. First, it
            requires separate firmware images for each unique combination of mocked components.
            Each image will need to be loaded onto the target separately, meaning there will be a
            lot of time waiting for the images to flash and set up tests. Mocking works by replacing
            a source file with another that contains functions of the same name. Thus, without a lot
            of work in the build system, a mock function will not be able to refer to the original
            function to 'turn off' the mock at runtime. CMock, for example, is not able to do this
            (at least to my knowledge). Second, this method is designed for manual execution through
            VSCode, although I will touch on a potential way of automating the process using idf.py
            directly in the command line at the end of the article.

            The documentation for a function that will be used as an example is shown below. The unit
            test written later will use mocks to verify that the function behaves in the way described.

            The firmware version file is available on a central server, so there is
            a dependency on the esp_http_client ESP-IDF component. Instead of esp_http_client
            functions, the function will call queryOTAUpdateAvailable, which is a function
            that exists in a project component named 'ota'. This can be mocked, removing 
            the need to connect to the server. As a side note, this brings up the 
            question of testing queryOTAUpdateAvailable without connecting to the server, 
            which is difficult to do cleanly. I haven't tackled the problem yet, but I will 
            note that ESP-IDF includes a mock of esp_http_client for Linux targets. Anyway,
            the other dependency is on the 'indicators' project component, whose main header
            file is shown below.

            In order to mock the indicators component for this particular test, a new project configuration
            is created in esp_idf_project_configuration.json or with the extension command "ESP-IDF: Open Project Configuration".
            This configuration will look something like the following, which uses a series of sdkconfig default
            files that define various build settings.

            The default files of note are 'sdkconfig.test' and 'sdkconfig.test_actions', which
            define configuration macros for all testing builds and specifically the actions test build, respectively.
            The 'sdkconfigFilePath' is set to a location that is different from other builds
            in order to reduce the amount of time spent building the entire ESP-IDF library.
            Finally, the 'executable' environment variable is the method's secret sauce,
            which will define which app_main to execute from and define the components to test.
            The 'sdkconfig.test_actions' file is contained in the test component of the actions 
            component and contains configuration options that control which components are mocked.

        I have two things to note about this file. First, I find it useful to replace certain setting macros
        with extern variables at times when testing to modify their values without rebuilding the entire
        image, however I am not sure whether this is a good programming practice. Second, there is only
        one 'test' component for each of your project components, however different unit tests may require
        different sets of mocked components. This issue can be solved by defining a configuration option
        that controls which tests get compiled and creating multiple 'sdkconfig.test_actions' files that contain
        a unique value for this option and unique set of mocks.

            In order to actually create the CMock source files, you can put the main CMock file path in your environment,
    navigate to the component you will create a mock for, and run a command like "ruby $Env:cmock -o CMockConfig.yml include/indicators.h".
    Small tip, if this command throws an error referencing "CMockConfig" instead of "CMockConfig.yml", your file probably contains
    a syntax error. Espressif is nice enough to link the CMock source files into a component called 'cmock'. With this and a
    mocking configuration option in the project component's Kconfig file, the component's CMakeLists.txt file can control
    whether the mock source file replaces the regular file. Note that component requirements should not depend on configuration choices
    because requirements are expanded before configuration is loaded.

        To explain the system concisely, the 'executable' environment variable controls
        which app_main file and test components are compiled. An sdkconfig.default
        file controls which components use their CMock replacements, and a test configuration
        option set in the file controls the unit tests that are compiled. Going back to the original
        example, CMock functions can now be used to verify that indicateOTAUpdate was called
        exactly once and no other indicators were called. Mocking the OTA component and task requires its
        own setup, but once everything is together the product is as follows.

    As stated in the beginning of the article, this process is with the VSCode extension, which
    is not directly automateable. I believe the extension implements multiple configurations with
    idf.py argument files, which are documented in the ESP-IDF documentation. I also believe that
    there is good integration between the Unity test framework and pytest if full automation in a
    CI/CD pipeline is your ultimate goal, although it is not something I have researched deeply yet.
    Another topic that may be interesting is testing with multiple tasks executing concurrently and
    ignoring particular mocked functions in some tasks but not others.
    Good luck testing!
