                New tasks are created in FreeRTOS through use of the function xTaskCreate, 
                whose function prototype is shown <span class="text-aside">to the right</span><span class="text-center">below</span>.
                xTaskCreate offers a lot of flexibility through the pvParameters argument,
                which is a void* that is passed to the new task. This is commonly used to
                connect the task to synchronization objects, such as when pvParameters points
                to a queue and is implicitly a QueueHandle_t. While using the argument in this
                way, the programmer can be reasonably confident it is not a dangling pointer
                because queues are usually designed to be in-scope for the entirety of the task's
                lifetime. If the task needs references to multiple synchronization objects,
                it is not as easy to assume that the pointer is valid.

            While working on a project that controls many LEDs via I2C commands to multiple LED matrix drivers,
            I decided to break up processing into three tasks. The first task handles initialization of the
            system before moving on to its day job: handling user button presses in a form of <a href="https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel-Book/blob/main/ch07.md#73-deferred-interrupt-processing" target="_blank">
            deferred interrupt processing</a>. It creates the other two tasks during initialization and provides
            them with references to synchronization objects. The second task, which is called the worker task, receives
            commands on a queue shared between it and the interrupt task. It potentially makes an HTTPS request or interacts 
            with non-volatile storage, then sends commands on another queue to a final task whose sole purpose is to handle LED animations and I2C transactions.

            For this program, the worker task needs pvParameters to point to two queues, which requires packaging
            them into a struct and passing a pointer to the struct instead of the individual queues. The code below shows how this
            can be done quickly in a small program, but the technique used is prone to error if refactoring occurs.

        Consider what will happen if the creation of the worker task is abstracted under an initialization function. 
        In that case, displayed below, the pointer given to the worker task will be invalid after the initialize function 
        returns and workerResources goes out of scope. The issue is that workerResources is created on app_main's 
        stack instead of in static memory or on the heap.

            Using stack memory will work only if the app_main task never gets deleted and
            workerResources is defined only in the scope of the app_main function. Some
            examples of alternative functions that create the worker task are presented
            below. The first allocates resources in static memory, which is useful in

            any given time; Second, when there will be multiple task instances, but the

            Another design uses heap allocation instead of static memory, which can be
            useful when the number of task instances isn't known at compile-time. If
            the task instances will be deleted, it is important that they free the struct
            allocated for them. In this design, the tasks have full ownership over their
            parameter. That is, they can modify the data, but must free the struct after use.

            The final design gives new tasks full ownership of resources located in static memory,
            as long as the number of task instances is known or capped at compile-time.
            This may be preferrable to the previous design if use of dynamic memory is 
            frowned upon in the project, which may be the case in safety-critical systems that must not reboot unexpectedly.

            Using these functions allows tasks to be created safely with proper
            parameters from any function in the app_main task. It also means that
            the createWorkerTask function can be placed near the vWorkerTask function
            in the code base, which will make it less likely that future changes to 
            parameters will result in unexpected memory errors. Happy coding!
